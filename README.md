# Notes-Pad-Application
This is a note-taking application developed during my free time. The main purpose of developing this application is for me to learn more about creating the Graphic User Interface(GUI) of a mobile application using Kotlin. Besides, I also learnt and implement Realm Database and notification in this system.
<br></br>

## System Introduction
This system is helping the user to take notes more efficiently:
* Simple UI that shows the list of notes clearly 
* Easily manage the note(Add, edit and delete)
* Reminder function that sends notification to the user  
<br></br>

## System Preview
1. In the landing page, there is a list of notes.
2. User can add a note and set a reminder for the note. 
3. After the reminder is set, there is a notification icon for that note in the landing page, to indicate that reminder has been set for the note.

</p>
<br></br>

4. When it is reminder time, a notification will be sent.
5. User can directly go to the note by pressing the notification.

6. When the note is opened, a confirmation message will pop out if the user select the back button or delete button.
7. When the user select the save button, validation on the reminder time will be performed.

</p>
<br></br>

8. User can select a note and edit the note.
9. In the landing page, there is a different notification icon for the note(e.g. Sample 9) to indicate that reminder for the note is triggered. Hence, the user can differentiate the upcoming and triggered reminder. 
10. User also can delete a note.
