# Notes-Pad-Application
This is a note-taking application developed during my free time. The main purpose of developing this application is for me to learn more about creating the Graphic User Interface(GUI) of a mobile application using Kotlin. Besides, I also learnt and implement Realm Database and notification in this system.
